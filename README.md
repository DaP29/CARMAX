# CARMAX
 CarMax Winter 2023 ShowCase

The data set is a sample of 200,000 customers who have purchased a car from CarMax and their accompanying appraisal details. An appraisal is an offer amount from CarMax to buy a customer's vehicle. Often, CarMax customers use the appraisal offer to purchase another vehicle through a trade-in.

Each row contains data on a customer's appraised vehicle and the vehicle they purchased from CarMax.
Appraised vehicle data can be identified by the suffix '_appraisal' (for example, 'make_appraisal' identifies the make of the vehicle customers sold to CarMax).

Challenge:
Many customers decide to trade-in their current vehicle when purchasing a vehicle at CarMax.
What does a customer's appraised vehicle tell us about the vehicle they will end up purchasing?
How can CarMax use this information to improve business operations and provide customers a personalized shopping experience?
